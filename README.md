This public repository is intended to act as a central point for PLC programmers across the globe to collaboratively work on the creation of a large JSONL data-set file intended to be used to make a fine-tuned GPT-3 model that can act as a structured text PLC code generator. 
This is essentially an identical product to Open AI's Codex model or Deep Minds AlphaCode but expressly trained for PLC strrctured text programming. 

I have created a proof of concept application that shows the ability of GPT-3 to create high quality structured text PLC code. 
Thw proof of concept is showcased in this video.

I have included in this repository my proof of concept application (you will need to use your own OpenAI API key and generatre your own model) and my current JSONL dataset file which was used to train the model in the above proof of concept video.
