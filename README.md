This public repository is intended to act as a central point for PLC programmers across the globe to collaboratively work on developing a large JSONL data-set file intended to be used in creating a fine-tuned GPT-3 model that can act as a structured text PLC code generator. 
This fine-tuned model would essentially be identical to Open AI's Codex model or Deep Minds AlphaCode but would be expressly trained for PLC structured text programming. 

I have created a proof-of-concept application that shows the ability of GPT-3 to create high quality structured text PLC code. 
The proof of concept is showcased in this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3rMZU0h4Iw

I have included in this repository my proof of concept application (you will need to use your own OpenAI API key and generatre your own FTM) and my current JSONL dataset file which was used to train the model in the above proof of concept video.
